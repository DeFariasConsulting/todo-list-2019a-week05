# Professor Charles' Superb Student List
In this project, I created an attendance list that allows the user to input names into a list and then click a button to display the full list of students that have been entered thus far.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Functions used: e.preventDefault, .push, .foreach, .innertext, createElement, .appendChild,  
## Optimizations

Make attendance list style that compares submitted list to class roster, allow easy clicking of pre-saved names into the list, allow removal of names from the list, add a student to permanent roster, style.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned, though have to re-learn how preventdefault, learned how to use createElement and appendChild
